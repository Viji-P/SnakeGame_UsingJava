Snake Game

Welcome to Snake Game, a classic arcade game implemented in Java using AWT and Swing libraries.

Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen eating food pellets. The snake grows longer as it consumes food, making it more challenging to navigate without colliding with itself or the walls. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.
